# My Linux Command Line Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my practical skills in using the Linux command line for various system administration and data analysis tasks. Each section contains detailed 
explanations, commands, and example outputs, often supported by screenshots, to demonstrate proficiency.

## Contents

* **[Essential Linux Commands: Navigation and Exploration](linux_basics/README.md):** Fundamental commands for navigating the filesystem, inspecting directories, and 
viewing file contents.
* **[Data Filtering and Manipulation with `grep` and Pipes](analisi_dati_shell/README.md):** Demonstrations of advanced data searching, filtering, and combining commands 
using standard input/output redirection.
* **[File and Directory Permissions Management](gestione_permessi/README.md):** Practical exercises on understanding, checking, and modifying file/directory permissions 
for effective access control and system security.

## Future Plans

This portfolio will be continuously updated with new projects and expanded skill sets, including:
* Advanced shell scripting for automation.
* More complex data processing techniques.
* A dedicated section on **SQL for Data Management and Analysis.**
* Projects involving cloud platforms and basic networking.
